## Download

The MoPub SDK is distributed as source code that you can include in your application.  MoPub provides two prepackaged archives of source code:

- **[MoPub Full SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/180lUGi)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML, MRAID, and Native MoPub advertisiments *and* built-in support for three major third party ad networks - [iAd](http://advertising.apple.com/), [Google AdMob](http://www.google.com/ads/admob/), and [Millennial Media](http://www.millennialmedia.com/) - including the required third party binaries.

- **[MoPub Base SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/19pPR1r)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML, MRAID, and Native MoPub advertisements.  No third party ad networks are included.

The current version of the SDK is 3.1.0

## Integrate

Integration instructions are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started).

More detailed class documentation is available in the repo under the `ClassDocumentation` folder.  This can be viewed [online too](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/blob/master/ClassDocumentation/index.html).

## New in this Version

Please view the [changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

- Updated native mediation framework to support Facebook Audience Network SDK 3.18.2
	- If you're directly using `MPNativeAd`, you should implement the `MPNativeAdDelegate` protocol found in `MPNativeAdDelegate.h` and set the delegate property on your `MPNativeAd` instance.
- Added convenience methods to `MPTableViewAdPlacer` and `MPCollectionViewAdPlacer` that default to using server-controlled native ad positioning
	- `+ (instancetype)placerWithTableView:viewController:defaultAdRenderingClass:(Class)defaultAdRenderingClass;`
	- `+ (instancetype)placerWithCollectionView:viewController:defaultAdRenderingClass:(Class)defaultAdRenderingClass;`
- Fixed compiler error in `MPDiskLRUCache.m` if `OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC` is false

### IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

As of version 3.0.0, the MoPub SDK uses Automatic Reference Counting. If you're upgrading from an earlier version (2.4.0 or earlier) that uses Manual Reference Counting, in order to minimize integration errors with the manual removal of the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag, our recommendation is to completely remove the existing MoPub SDK from your project and then integrate the latest version. Alternatively, you can manually remove the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag from all MoPub SDK files. If your project uses Manual Reference Counting, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to all MoPub SDK files.

## Requirements

iOS 5.0 and up
